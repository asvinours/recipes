# Pizza dough

## Ingredients

- [ ] 400g flour
- [ ] 300ml warm water (~40c)
- [ ] 2tsp sugar
- [ ] 2 tsp salt
- [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 2 tsp instant yeast


## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water and stir in yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center, add the yeast mixture and olive oil.

3. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.

4. Kneading the Dough:

   - Lightly flour your countertop.
   - Push: Using the heel of your hand, push the dough away from you.
   - Fold: Fold the far edge of the dough back toward the center.
   - Turn: Rotate the dough a quarter turn and repeat the push-fold motion.
   - Continue for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
   - Windowpane test: Pinch off a piece and stretch gently. If it becomes thin and translucent without
tearing, it's ready.

After Kneading: Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, until doubled in size.
