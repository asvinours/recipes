# Dacquoise praliné-chocolat

## Praliné noisette

### Ingredients

- [ ] 300g of hazelnuts
- [ ] 200g of sugar
- [ ] 1 pinch of salt (optional)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 150°C (300°F).
2. Place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes. Keep a close eye on them as they can burn quickly. The hazelnuts are ready when they are lightly golden and have a nutty aroma.
3. Let the hazelnuts cool slightly, then rub them with a clean cloth to remove as much skin as possible. This doesn’t need to be perfect.
4. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the sugar. Heat over medium heat and let the sugar melt slowly without stirring. You can gently swirl the pan if needed. Let it continue to cook until it turns a golden amber color.
5. As soon as the caramel is ready, remove the pan from the heat and quickly add the toasted hazelnuts. Stir quickly to coat the hazelnuts in caramel.
6. Pour the caramel and hazelnut mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat and let it cool completely.
7. Once the praline is cold and hardened, break it into pieces and place it in a blender or food processor.
8. Blend the pieces at high speed. Initially, you’ll get a coarse powder, but continue blending until the natural oils from the hazelnuts turn the powder into a smooth paste. You can add a pinch of salt or vanilla extract at this stage if desired.

Your hazelnut praliné is now ready to be used in your recipes or can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature.
