# Crème brûlée

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 cups heavy cream
- [ ] 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
- [ ] 1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus 6 tablespoons for topping
- [ ] 6 large egg yolks
- [ ] 2 cups hot water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
2. In a medium saucepan, heat the heavy cream and vanilla bean over medium heat until steaming.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of sugar until well combined.
4. Gradually whisk the hot cream into the egg mixture, being careful not to cook the eggs.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup.
6. Divide the mixture evenly among 6 (6-oz) ramekins.
7. Place the ramekins in a large baking dish, and pour the hot water into the dish to come about 1 inch up the sides of the ramekins.
8. Bake until the crème brûlée is just set, about 35-40 minutes.
9. Remove the ramekins from the baking dish and let cool to room temperature. Then, refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.
10. Just before serving, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar evenly over each ramekin. Using a kitchen torch, caramelize 
    the sugar until it is a deep golden brown. Serve immediately.

Enjoy your creamy, rich and delicious crème brûlée!
