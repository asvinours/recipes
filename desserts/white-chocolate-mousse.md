# White Chocolate Mousse

## Ingredients

- [ ] 7 ounces white chocolate, chopped
- [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
- [ ] 7 egg whites
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- [ ] 3 tablespoons sugar

## Instructions

1. Place the white chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.
2. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream until it just begins to simmer.
3. Pour the hot cream over the chopped white chocolate and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.
4. Allow the mixture to cool for about 5 minutes.
5. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
6. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.
7. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cooled chocolate mixture, being careful not to deflate the egg whites.
8. Spoon the mixture into individual serving dishes or one large dish.
9. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set.
10. Serve chilled, topped with fresh fruit or whipped cream, if desired.

This white chocolate mousse is rich, creamy, and indulgent. The combination of melted white chocolate and whipped egg whites creates 
a light and airy texture that is perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the white chocolate.

You can also balance the richness of the white chocolate mousse by serving it with fresh fruit, 
such as berries, or with a [light and crisp cookie](/snacks/lemon-sables.md).

Enjoy!
