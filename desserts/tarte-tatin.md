# Tarte Tatin

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- [ ] 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter
- [ ] 6-8 medium apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
- [ ] 1 sheet of store-bought or homemade puff pastry, thawed if frozen
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Calvados or brandy (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In an oven-safe 9-inch (23cm) non-stick skillet or heavy-bottomed frying pan, melt the sugar and butter over medium heat. 
   Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is a light golden color, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the sliced apples to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly browned and just starting to soften, about 10 minutes.
4. Remove the skillet from heat and, using a fork, arrange the apple slices in a single layer on top of the caramel mixture.
5. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface until it is slightly larger than the diameter of the skillet.
6. Place the puff pastry on top of the apples, tucking the edges of the pastry down the sides of the skillet.
7. Bake the tarte in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.
8. Remove the tarte from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes.
9. Invert the tarte onto a serving plate, so that the apples are on top.
10. If desired, drizzle the Calvados or brandy over the apples. Serve the tarte warm, with a dollop of crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious and classic Tarte Tatin!
