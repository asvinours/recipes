## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine chopped spinach, crumbled feta cheese, and chopped sundried tomatoes.
3. Slice each chicken breast horizontally, creating a pocket for the stuffing. Be sure not to cut all the way through.
4. Stuff each chicken breast with 1/4 of the spinach and feta mixture.
5. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
6. In a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil.
7. Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown.
8. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
9. In the same skillet, add sliced red bell pepper, yellow onion, and sliced zucchini.
10. Saute the vegetables until they start to soften, about 5-7 minutes.
11. Add chopped fresh thyme and stir to combine.
12. Return the chicken to the skillet, nestling it among the vegetables.
13. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
14. Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh thyme if desired.
