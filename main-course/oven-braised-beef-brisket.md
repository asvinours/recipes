# oven-braised beef brisket

## Ingredients:

- [ ] 4-5 pound beef brisket
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 2 onions, sliced
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- [ ] 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- [ ] 1 cup beef broth
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry red wine
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- [ ] 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C).
2. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Sear the brisket on all sides until browned, about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove the brisket from the pot and set it aside.
3. Add the sliced onions to the pot and sauté until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic, tomato paste, smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, kosher salt, and black pepper. Stir until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
4. Pour in beef broth and dry red wine. Add bay leaves and bring the mixture to a simmer.
5. Return the brisket to the pot, cover it with a lid, and place it in the preheated oven. Cook for 3-4 hours or until the brisket is tender and can be easily pierced with a fork.
6. Remove the pot from the oven and transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes.
7. While the brisket is resting, strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan and discard the bay leaves. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat.
8. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and water until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture to the cooking liquid, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 2-3 minutes.
9. Slice the brisket against the grain and serve it with the sauce.

Enjoy your oven-braised beef brisket!
