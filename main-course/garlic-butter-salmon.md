# Garlic Butter Baked Salmon

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 side of salmon fillet 3 pound
- [ ] 6 sprigs fresh dill
- [ ] 2 lemons thinly sliced
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic minced
- [ ] 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- [ ] kosher salt to taste
- [ ] black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Take the salmon out of the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature while you prepare the foil and garlic butter.
2. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F and line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of foil. Spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray to prevent the salmon from sticking.
3. In the middle of the foil, lay 3 sprigs of dill and 1 thinly sliced lemon. This will add flavor to the salmon while it bakes.
4. Lay the salmon on top of the dill and lemon, skin side down. Roll up the sides of the foil to create a pouch around the salmon. This will help to steam the salmon and keep it moist.
5. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and garlic over low heat. Pour the garlic butter over the salmon. Season the salmon with kosher salt and black pepper to taste.
6. Add the remaining dill and lemon slices over the top of the salmon to enhance the flavor.
7. Gently tent the salmon with foil, being careful not to let the foil touch the top of the salmon. Bake the salmon for about 15 minutes or until it is almost fully cooked.
8. Remove the salmon from the oven and carefully remove the top piece of foil.
9. Place the baking rack about 6 inches from the top of the oven. Return the salmon to the oven and broil it for 3-5 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned. Keep a close eye on the salmon to prevent it from burning.

Enjoy your delicious garlic butter baked salmon!
