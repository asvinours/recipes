## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine the garlic, spices, lemon juice, and olive oil to make a marinade. Add the chicken thighs, ensuring they're well-coated, and leave them to marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
2. For the garlic yogurt sauce, mix the Greek yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
3. Grill the marinated chicken thighs on medium heat until fully cooked, about 6-7 minutes each side.
4. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then cut into thin slices.
5. To assemble the wraps, spread some of the garlic yogurt sauce on a flatbread or pita. Add the sliced chicken and your choice of fresh vegetables. If you like, add pickles for some tanginess.
6. Roll the wrap tightly and enjoy.
