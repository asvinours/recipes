# pan-seared duck breast

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 duck breasts, about 8-10 ounces each
- [ ] Salt and pepper
- [ ] 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- [ ] 1 tablespoon butter
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 sprigs fresh thyme

## Instructions

1. Remove the duck breasts from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. This will ensure even cooking.
2. Score the skin of each duck breast in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat. This will help the fat render out and create a crispy skin.
3. Season the duck breasts generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.
5. Place the duck breasts in the skillet, skin side down. Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy.
6. Flip the duck breasts over and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side.
7. Remove the duck breasts from the skillet and let them rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes.
8. While the duck is resting, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic, and thyme to the skillet. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.
9. Slice the duck breasts thinly and serve with the garlic-thyme butter drizzled on top.

Enjoy your delicious pan-seared duck breast!
