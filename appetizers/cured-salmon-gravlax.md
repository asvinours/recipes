# Cured Salmon Gravlax

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 tbsp white peppercorns (whole) (Note 1)
- [ ] 1 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped (1 big bunch)
- [ ] 250g / 8 oz rock salt (Note 2)
- [ ] 250g / 8 oz white sugar (Note 3)
- [ ] 1 kg / 2 lb salmon, sashimi-grade, bones removed and skin on (Note 4)

### Mustard cream sauce

- [ ] 1/2 cup / 125 ml heavy / thickened cream
- [ ] 1/3 cup Dijon Mustard (or hot mustard if you want a kick)
- [ ] 2 tsp Mustard Powder
- [ ] Salt and pepper

### To serve

- [ ] Rye bread slices or other bread/crackers (Note 5)
- [ ] Lemon wedges
- [ ] 1/4 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Crush peppercorns with the side of a knife (or roughly grind using mortar and pestle).
2. Combine peppercorns with salt, sugar and dill.
3. Place 2 large pieces of cling wrap on a work surface, slightly overlapping. Spread half the salt mixture in the shape of the salmon.
4. Place salmon on salt, skin side down. Top with remaining salt mixture.
5. Wrap with cling wrap. Place in a large dish. Top with something flat (like small cutting board) then 3 x 400g / 14oz cans ("Weights").
6. Refrigerate for 12 hours. There will be liquid in the dish. Turn salmon over (will be gloopy/wet)), then replace Weights and return to fridge. 
   After another 12 hours, turn salmon over again, replace Weights. After another 12 hours, remove salmon from fridge. 36 hours total for Medium Cure
7. Unwrap salmon, scrape off salt then rinse. Pat dry. If time permits, return to the fridge for 3 - 12 hours uncovered.
8. Sprinkle over the 1/4 cup extra dill - for garnish and flavour.
9. Slice thinly on an angle, do not cut through skin (i.e. don't eat skin). Serve with toasted bread, Mustard Sauce, extra dill and lemon wedges.

### Mustard sauce

Mix ingredients, making sure to season with salt and pepper. 

It should taste like a creamy mustard - a touch of tartness, but mostly to add moisture to the dish. 
You can add lemon juice and/or zest if you wish

## Notes

### Curing strength

- `Medium Cure`: surface is fairly firm and not too salty, inside is lightly cured, still moist (but not raw, itâ€™s cured). 
                 Seasoned enough to eat slices plain.
- `Hard Cure`: surface is quite firm (like a soft jerky) and quite well seasoned, inside is slightly firmer and pretty well seasoned. 
               Contrast between surface and inside more prominent
